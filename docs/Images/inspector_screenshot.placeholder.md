# Inspector Screenshot Placeholder

Target file: `inspector_screenshot.png`

Expected evidence content:
- Blender inspector view with face-level attributes visible
- `osm_id` and encoded legend/code fields visible in-panel
- Scene object context visible enough to confirm this is not a synthetic mock

Why this placeholder exists:
- A real runtime screenshot must be captured from an actual Blender session.
- This repository update adds the documentation slot and naming contract for that artifact.
